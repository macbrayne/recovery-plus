# Recovery+

This mod modifies the new 1.19 Recovery Compasses to not only work in the dimension you died in but also lead you there - retracing your steps you took to get there.
This makes it ideal for exploration: when you explore a ruined Nether Portal, when you explore end islands, when you just don't know how exactly you got somewhere but died.

Whenever you change dimension using Nether Portals or End Portals or use End Gateways this is recorded and added to a backlog. That way the recovery compass knows where to lead you. If you reach a waypoint (a nether portal you took etc.) the recovery compass then changes focus on to the next step of your journey to get your stuff back.
