# Recovery+

This mod adds a version of the standard 1.19 recovery compass craftable using 4 redstone and one recovery compass.

This new and improved Recovery Compass not only works in the dimension you died in but can also lead you there - retracing the steps you took to get there.
This makes it ideal for exploration: when you explore a ruined Nether Portal, explore end islands, or when you just don't know how exactly you got to where you died.

Whenever you change dimension using Nether Portals or End Portals or use End Gateways it is recorded and a new waypoint is added to a backlog.
Then when you die the new recovery compass points you to the next waypoint. If you reach a waypoint the recovery compass then focuses on to the next step of your journey to get your stuff back.
