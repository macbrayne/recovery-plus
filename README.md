Welcome to Recovery+!

With only four redstone you can transform your boring, death dimension only, vanilla Recovery Compass into an exciting portal tracking, dimension guiding, Smart Recovery Compass.

This new and improved Recovery Compass also works in the dimensions you traversed before dying - retracing the steps you took to get to your point of death.
This makes it ideal for exploration: when you explore a ruined Nether Portal, explore end islands, or when you just don't know how exactly you got to where you died.


Whenever you change dimension using Nether Portals or End Portals or you use an End Gateway it's recorded and a new waypoint is added to a backlog.
Then when you die the new recovery compass points you to the first portal you crossed. If you reach a waypoint the recovery compass then focuses on to the next step of your journey to get your stuff back.

## Roadmap

After Modfest new features like support for portals from other mods, a compass that only points north for when you don't have access to a local map, and eventually also a compass that can track entities (useful e.g. for finding lost horses) are going to be added.
