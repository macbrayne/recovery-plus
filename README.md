This new and improved Recovery Compass also works in the dimension you traversed before dying - retracing the steps you took to get to your point of death.
This makes it ideal for exploration: for example when you explore a ruined Nether Portal, explore end islands, or when you just don't know how exactly you got to where you died.


Whenever you change dimension using Nether Portals or End Portals or you use an End Gateway it's recorded and a new waypoint is added to a backlog.
Then when you die the new recovery compass points you to the first portal you crossed. If you reach a waypoint the recovery compass then focuses on to the next step of your journey to get your stuff back.
